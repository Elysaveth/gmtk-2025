~ start

Well... Here we are. This is supposed to be my school for the next three years
They say theese are the most important years of my life, where everything begins.
I'm still not sure what that means...
- Go to the ceremony
- Wait for a bit
	I just don't feel like going yet...
- I just don't wanna play the game => END
I guess I should get moving => ceremony

~ ceremony

That was boring enough.[wait=10] I'll just go home

=> END
